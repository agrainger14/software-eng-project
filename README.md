# software-eng-project

This GUI based game was developed as part of my software engineering module. A game was developed to be played in the console with rules similar to monopoly and an environmental friendly theme to 'Save Our Planet'.
This project gave me exposure to working within a team environment with 3 other students to plan, construct UML, develop and test a simple GUI based game while applying OOP principles in Java.

Save Our Planet Game.

Game Rules

•	Players will work in a team of 2-4 players and their names will be entered at the beginning of the game. Duplicate names are not allowed. 

•	The players begin with 300 Eco-Funds which are obtained as a currency. Each player takes a turn, on their turn they throw two virtual dice at a time to make their way around the board in search of areas to purchase.  

•	When a player lands on an area they are displayed information relating to the status of the area. If the area is not owned, the player may pay Eco-Funds to take control of that area and become the owner. If the player does not wish to purchase this area, it remains available to be purchased by another player. 

•	When a player lands on an area owned by another player, the player will invest Eco-Funds to the area owner to help on the shared quest to save the planet. 

•	When a player passes the start square, they will collect 200 Eco-Funds to continue their quest to purchase/develop areas to save the Planet. If the player lands on the start square, they will gain an additional 100 Eco-Funds (300 total). 

•	When a player lands on the ‘Do Nothing’ square the player will take a break from saving the planet, effectively skipping their turn.  

•	When all players have made a lap through the board, the global average temperature will be increased by 0.2oC. 

•	When a player owns all areas within a field, they can start to develop each area on their turn to reduce the global average temperature. Developments can be made even if the player has not landed on that specific area. Three minor development and one major are needed to fully develop the area. 

•	If a player owns several fields, they are only allowed to choose one area on their turn to develop.  

•	Once all areas have been fully developed, CONGRATULATIONS!! You have saved the planet.  

•	If a player runs out of Eco-Funds, quits the game, purchases an area owned by another player or if the global average temperature has reached 2°C, GAME OVER you have not been able to save the planet.  

•	Once the game ends, a summary of the game will be displayed to the players to show their progression throughout the game.
